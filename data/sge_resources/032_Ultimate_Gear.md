**ULTIMATE SETS**

Please note: these sets have not been updated for 7.0. However, they should still work.

**TOP Sets**

You can find all the sets and approximate DPS numbers here: [<https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sge/endwalker/top>](https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cb965ec32-84e8-43cb-962a-f38cdefc6ffd)

**DSW Sets**

You can find all the sets and approximate DPS numbers here: [<https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sge/endwalker/dsr>](https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cdd937de0-2089-4378-acf5-91bf8db39965)

As of Dawntrail's first Savage tier, we are able to comfortably run minimal SPS on Sage. The above sets for DSR and TOP have been created with both the AAC-LHW Savage weapon and the Endwalker relic weapon depending on how much spell speed you feel is sufficient for your needs.

**TEA, UWU, and UCOB gear**
For these fights the easiest thing to do is just use synced gear. You can use `!faq ultimatesync` to see the ilvl requirements to max both substats with synced gear in each fight. Note that even 580 and 590 gear will work fine in TEA even if it doesn't fully cap the lower substat.
