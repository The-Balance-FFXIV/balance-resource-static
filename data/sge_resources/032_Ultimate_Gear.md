**ULTIMATE SETS**

Please note: these sets have not been updated for 7.0. However, they should still work.

**TOP Sets**

You can find all the sets and approximate DPS numbers here: <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cb965ec32-84e8-43cb-962a-f38cdefc6ffd>

You can play around with the sets by clicking "Save As" under the table to make your own copy of the sheet.

2.41 Crit/Det Relic
One possible option for players with an up-to-date relic, and the slowest set of the bunch. Provides a tiny bit more DPS than the SpS set, at the expense of slightly less mobility than the faster set.

2.39 Crit/SpS Relic
Another relic option. This set gives a slightly faster GCD, giving it a little bit more mobility than the 2.41 set.

2.40 Non-Relic
Provides about a hundred simulated DPS less than the other two sets, but is the best option for players who do not have an ilvl 645 relic yet.

**DSW Sets**

You can find all the sets and approximate DPS numbers here: <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cdd937de0-2089-4378-acf5-91bf8db39965>

Note that if you do not yet have the DSR weapon itself, the 6.25 relic is slightly better than the Asphodelos (i605) weapon.

**TEA, UWU, and UCOB gear**
For these fights the easiest thing to do is just use synced gear. You can use `!faq ultimatesync` to see the ilvl requirements to max both substats with synced gear in each fight. Note that even 580 and 590 gear will work fine in TEA even if it doesn't fully cap the lower substat.
